It is the sixth film in the Harry Potter film series. David Yates, the director of the fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, directed this film. David Heyman and David Barron produced,[3] and Steve Kloves, though he did not write the fifth film, has returned as screenwriter for this instalment.[4] Filming began on September 24, 2007. The film was released in the UK, Canada and US on July 15, 2009 in regular theatres, and an IMAX 3-D release on July 29, 2009.[5][4][6] Unlike the previous film, the sixth film was released in regular theatres on July 15 and IMAX 3-D on July 29 because of the IMAX release of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[7] The film was chosen to be screened at the Royal Film Performance on November 17, 2008, but due to the date of release being pushed back, it was not shown. On January 2, 2009, the film received a PG rating in the USA. On July 7, 2009, at the world film premiere of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in London, the cast and crew all wore white ribbons in memory and tribute of 18-year-old British actor and co-star Robert Knox. Knox, who played Marcus Belby in the film, was stabbed to death on May 24, 2008."
